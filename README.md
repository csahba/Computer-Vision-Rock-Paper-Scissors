# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock paper scissors game using computer vision
## Generating the model
- Teachable Machine provides fast and easy models using a webcam and browser to generate training sets for various classes, that we can then export for use with keras

## Running it locally
- Using conda for combined virtual environment and package management

## Game logic
- Starting with a manual game using random computer selection versus user text input, with multiple rounds

## Bringing it all together
- Using the keras model to take user input via webcam versus a random computer selection with a timer
- During the writing of this I moved between various rooms and noticed this had an impact on accuracy of model prediction, to improve this a larger and more varied training set could be used, particularly with a variety of different backgrounds.
